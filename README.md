# Lung-Image-Segmentation
Lung Image Segmentation using cGAN (Pix2Pix)This project implements a medical image segmentation pipeline using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN), specifically the Pix2Pix architecture. The goal is to automatically segment lung regions from Chest X-ray images to assist in image-guided surgery and the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases like tuberculosis.🚀 Project OverviewImage segmentation in medical contexts helps extract regions of interest (ROI) from complex scans. Pix2Pix has proven effective for image-to-image translation tasks, including:Medical image segmentation (Converting X-rays to binary masks)Image denoising and restorationThe model utilizes a U-Net generator and a PatchGAN discriminator to learn the mapping from an observed X-ray image to its corresponding binary lung mask.📊 DatasetThe project utilizes paired Chest X-ray datasets with binary masks. The data is sourced from the Mendeley Data Lung Segmentation Dataset.Sources Used:Montgomery County Dataset: 138 images (Maryland, USA)Shenzhen Dataset: 566 images (Shenzhen, China)The combined dataset includes posteroanterior chest X-rays and associated radiologist readings, focusing on both normal and abnormal (tuberculosis) manifestations.🛠️ Installation & SetupPrerequisitesPython 3.xTensorFlow / KerasOpenCVMatplotlibNumPyEnvironmentThis project is designed to run in Google Colab with GPU acceleration enabled. It includes automated scripts to:Mount Google Drive.Extract dataset zip files.Pre-process and combine X-rays with their respective masks.⚙️ Data Pre-processingThe pipeline includes several critical pre-processing steps:Image Stitching: X-rays and masks are concatenated horizontally into a single image for the Pix2Pix model.Train/Test Split: An 80:20 split is applied to the combined data.Resizing: Images are resized to 512x1024 (to accommodate two 512x512 images side-by-side).Augmentation: Includes random jittering, cropping (to 256x256), and horizontal mirroring to improve model generalization.🏗️ ArchitectureGenerator: A U-Net based architecture that uses an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections to preserve spatial information.Discriminator: A PatchGAN (Patch-based discriminator) that classifies individual $N \times N$ patches as real or fake, promoting high-frequency detail.📈 Performance & ResultsThe model is evaluated using the Dice Coefficient, a standard metric for image segmentation accuracy.Average Dice Coefficient: ~0.938This high score indicates a strong overlap between the predicted lung masks and the ground truth provided by radiologists.
